# newsSearchApp

The News Search program utilizes the javascript framework of React to allow a user to search the Hacker News API.   The application consists of 2 pages.  The search page allows the user to enter a search term to query the Hacker News API for articles.   The results returned from the API query are displayed after clicking the Search button.  The application displays the title, the author and a button to view the article.  

The second page is the history page.  This page displays a list of all the search terms the user searched on.  These search terms are only retained for the session and not through a refresh.  The search terms are handled via a store for state management.
