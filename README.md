# newsSearchApp

The News Search program utilizes javascript framework of React to allow a user to search the Hacker News API.   The search term used by the user returns results from the API and displays the title, author and a button to view the url of the article.  There is also a second page to this program that displays a list of all the search terms the user searched on.  These search terms are only kept in this session and not through a refresh.  The search terms are handled via a store for state management.

## Installation

* Install dependencies by executing the following in a terminal window in directory where files were copied.
